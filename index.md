I'm a sociologist, I know how to code, I love cooking healthy food, and there is paper back home that says I hold a BA in design. These are different approaches I’ve found to explore our culture and lifestyle.

I’m a [PhD student in Sociology](https://www.essex.ac.uk/sociology/staff/profile.aspx?ID=3456) at the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk) and I’m also involved in many side projects, such as [Expedição Liberdade](http://expedicaoliberdade.com.br). I’m also part of some innovative platforms such as [Mútuo](https://vimeo.com/72760145), [Nós.vc](http://nos.vc) and [Sistêmico](https://github.com/danielweinmann/sistemico). And I develop and contribute to open source projects, such as [InternetSemLimites](https://github.com/InternetSemLimites), [GetGist](https://github.com/cuducos/getgist) and [jQuery Price Format](http://jquerypriceformat.com). In the past I was aproject leader for a innovation consultancy called [Insitum](http://insitum.com).

In sum I'm a geek interested in sociology, collaborative economy and crowdsourcing in general. All in all, I’m delving into how change can emerge from micro-social spheres.

I'm based in Brazil and in the UK.
