Autonomy is what I treasure the most. A world with more autonomous individuals is a better world for all of us. In my pursue for empowerment I have been learning from and sharing with awesome people. And in this journey, while hacking cultures and lifestyles, I had technology, sociology and design as my super powers.

If is there any truth to be known it is within ourselves. I am always looking for mindfulness. I can find some peace of mind when I'm surrounded by people, in meditation, going out for a run, or even while bread baking. I can also find it in a glass of a good scotch whisky or in a Bob Dylan album.

In sum I'm a geek interested in the social, in culture and politics. I have inherited a _hands on_ mood from the BA in Graphic Design I hold. My passion for technology introduced me the idea of hacking. And as a [PhD student in sociology](https://www.essex.ac.uk/sociology/staff/profile.aspx?ID=3456) I enjoy reflecting upon common relationships of our daily life.

I’m involved in many side projects such as [Expedição Liberdade](http://www.expedicaoliberdade.com.br), [Mútuo](https://vimeo.com/72760145), [Sistêmico](https://github.com/danielweinmann/sistemico), [InternetSemLimites](https://github.com/InternetSemLimites) and [Cunha já caiu?](http://www.cunhajacaiu.com.br). I'm also engaged in open source founding — and collaborating to — [various projects](http://github.com/cuducos/).

I'm based in Brazil and in the UK. Feel free to join me if you believe in the _power to the people_ motto : )
