I love hacking our culture and lifestyle. I'm a geek interested in society, culture and politics. I focus on autonomy and on how change can emerge from micro-social spheres.

I’m a [PhD student in Sociology](https://www.essex.ac.uk/sociology/staff/profile.aspx?ID=3456) at the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk) and I’m also involved in many side projects such as [Expedição Liberdade](http://www.expedicaoliberdade.com.br), [Mútuo](https://vimeo.com/72760145), [Sistêmico](https://github.com/danielweinmann/sistemico), [InternetSemLimites](https://github.com/InternetSemLimites) and [Cunha já caiu?](http://www.cunhajacaiu.com.br). I'm engaged in open source founding — and collaborating to — [various projects](http://github.com/cuducos/).

Nowadays I'm based in Brazil and in the UK.
